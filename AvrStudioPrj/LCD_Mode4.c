      Summary:    4-bit data interface, busy flag not implemented.
                  Any LCD pin can be connected to any available I/O port.
                  Includes a simple write string routine.

/******************************* Program Notes ******************************
 
            This program uses a 4-bit data interface but does not use the
              busy flag to determine when the LCD controller is ready.  The
              LCD RW line (pin 5) is not connected to the uP and it must be
              connected to GND for the program to function.
 
            All time delays are longer than those specified in most datasheets
              in order to accommodate slower than normal LCD modules.  This
              requirement is well documented but almost always ignored.  The
              information is in a note at the bottom of the right hand
              (Execution Time) column of the instruction set.
 
  ***************************************************************************
 
            The four data lines as well as the two control lines may be
              implemented on any available I/O pin of any port.  These are
              the connections used for this program:

// Since the LCD module is wired for the 4-bit mode, only the upper four data lines are connected to

//   four data lines and the lower four data lines will be high (due to internal pull-up circuitry).
